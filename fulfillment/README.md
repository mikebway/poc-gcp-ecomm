# The gRPC Fulfillment Orchestration Microservice

The **Fulfillment Orchestration Service** is a skeleton implementation of a fulfillment orchestration and status 
service. It's purpose is not to serve in an actual online business but as a test bed to explore:

* Building and deploying a GCP Cloud Run service
* Implementing a gRPC API CRUD microservice on Cloud Run
* Utilizing Cloud Firestore as the backend database

## Planned Enhancements
