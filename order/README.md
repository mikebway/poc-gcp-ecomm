# The gRPC Order Microservice

The **Order Service** is a crude implementation of an e-commerce order history archive. It's purpose is not to serve in
an actual online business but as a test bed to explore:

* Building and deploying a GCP Cloud Run service
* Implementing a gRPC API CRUD microservice on Cloud Run
* Utilizing Cloud Firestore as the backend database

## Planned Enhancements

See [The gRPC Cart Microservice](../cart/README.md#planned-enhancements)
